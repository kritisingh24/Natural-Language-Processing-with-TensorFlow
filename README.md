# Natural-Language-Processing-with-TensorFlow

### 1) Text Classification 
   #### Dataset : https://storage.googleapis.com/wdd-2-node.appspot.com/x1.json
   Classifying news headlines as sarcastic and non-sarcastic. Sequential neural network model has been used with the embedding layer, elatten layer, dense layer with activation function 'relu' and dense layer with activation function 'sigmoid'.
   
   Compilation of the model is performed using loss - binary_crossentropy, optimizer - adam and metrics - accuracy.
   
   ##### Embeddings projection on TensorFlow projector:
   Created vector - vectors.ts and meta file - vectors.ts from embedding layer
